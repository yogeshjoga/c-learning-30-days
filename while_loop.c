//loops 1st while loop 
//loop task is 1 to 100 number's print by using C programming lang
void main(){
    int a=1, b=100; //integers 
    while(a <= b){  // while loop started now and take a condiation
        printf("This is the While loop %d \n", a); // print the lower value of integer 
        a++; //A int to increment upto B value is 100, so upto 100 values
    }
    
}
// notes
// * while loop is a most basic loop in C programming. while loop has one control condition,
// It executes as long the condition is true.  The condition of the loop is tested before the body of the loop is executed 
// C while loops statement allows to repeatedly run the same block of code until a condition is met.
// thank you today learnt a lot bye bye see you later.
